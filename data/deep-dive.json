The challenge is timing: trading just 7% below all-time highs with 90-day returns of +18%, much of the near-term upside has been captured. WATCHLIST for a pullback to the mid-$60s where the forward PE compresses to ~24x and risk/reward improves. The structural story (global retail trading growth, crypto adoption, automation moat) remains compelling for long-term holders."

At 17.7x forward PE with 84.2% gross margins and 104.4% earnings acceleration, PTC offers the best value in this cohort on a quality-adjusted basis. The 30% drawdown from highs has compressed the multiple well below comparables like ANSS (32x), CDNS (40x), and ADSK (28x), creating a potential valuation re-rating opportunity. The revenue growth of 21.4% is the constraint \u2014 it's solid but not explosive \u2014 which keeps this at WATCHLIST rather than BUY. A confirmed acceleration in revenue growth above 25% would warrant upgrading to BUY at current levels."
