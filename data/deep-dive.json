Per description, it builds GPU cloud infrastructure for GenAI workloads. The bull case is straightforward: AI compute demand continues scaling and CRWV captures share. The bear case is equally clear: -$6.95B FCF and $18.8B debt on a $51B market cap is an existential risk if demand slows. The 17.36% short interest (declining) reflects this tension. 18 of 30 analysts rate buy with targets ranging from $41 to $251 \u2014 the range itself tells the story of binary outcomes. This is a high-conviction directional bet on the AI infrastructure cycle, not a value investment."
