The AI tailwind for semiconductor testing is real and structural. However, at $343 the stock trades above every analyst target metric (mean $302.71, median $315) at 42.7x forward earnings after a 107% rally in 90 days. The growth story is compelling but fully priced; this is a Watchlist for a pullback entry rather than a chase at current levels."

With a net cash balance sheet, 22% ROE, and unanimous analyst Buy consensus, AGI combines growth with quality. The primary risk is gold price reversion, but at 15.75x forward earnings with this growth profile, the stock offers reasonable value even near its 52-week high."
