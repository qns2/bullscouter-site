The earnings miss created the entry opportunity. FCF generation is exceptional for the sector, and buybacks provide a floor. Main risk is that thin margins leave no room for error if macro deteriorates. The 7.4% short interest adds squeeze potential on any positive catalyst. This is a value play, not a growth story — expect multiple expansion, not revenue acceleration."
