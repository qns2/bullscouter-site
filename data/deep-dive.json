At 25.1x forward earnings (PEG 0.40), the valuation is reasonable relative to growth, and the 60/63 analyst buy consensus reflects near-universal conviction. The primary risk is AI capex cyclicality, but NVIDIA's CUDA moat and inference growth provide a longer-duration thesis than a typical hardware cycle."
