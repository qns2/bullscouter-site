The product diversification into cash advances beyond traditional lending, combined with deeply oversold technical levels and positive market sentiment, positions UPST for a significant rebound as the new product gains traction. While insider selling presents near-term headwinds, the extreme valuation discount and successful product launch catalyst outweigh this concern for tactical buyers entering at current levels.",
